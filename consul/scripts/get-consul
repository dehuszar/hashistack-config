# this script can accept the arguments:
# -v to specify the version to download, and
# -a to specify which architecture to download
# valid architectures are x86, amd64, arm[default], and arm64

# this allows the script to take params to override the defaults; e.g.
# bash service-init 1.6.2 amd64
# TODO :: implement flag enumeration so they don't have to be ordered
# i.e. if I want to override 2, I have to provide 1
